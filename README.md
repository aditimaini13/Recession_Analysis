# Recession Analysis Project
This repository contains a project focused on analyzing recessions using Python. The project utilizes a dataset from Statso.io to perform an in-depth analysis of economic recessions, particularly focusing on the growth in GDP, unemployment rate, and consumer spending rate.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project provides historical economic data that is crucial for recession analysis. The dataset was relatively clean, but some data wrangling was required to extract additional columns and features for a comprehensive analysis.

## Project Summary
The main objectives of the project were:

Visualizing GDP Growth Over Time: The project started with visualizing the growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) over time. This visualization provides a high-level understanding of the economic trends.

Converting Monthly Data to Quarterly Data: Economic indicators are often reported on a monthly basis. To analyze recessions, it's common to convert this data into quarterly intervals. This step simplifies the analysis and aligns with the standard practice.

Calculating and Analyzing Recession: The heart of the project involves identifying and analyzing recessions. A recession is defined as a situation where the circulation of money in the economy is low for two consecutive quarters. By calculating the GDP growth rate on a quarterly basis, the project identifies and analyzes recessionary periods.

Analyzing Recession Severity: Apart from identifying recessions, this project delves into assessing the severity of a recession. Severity refers to how deeply and protractedly the economy contracts during a recession. This analysis involves examining the negative impact on various economic indicators, including employment, income, and other relevant factors.

## Python Techniques Used
The project extensively employs Python to accomplish its objectives. Here are the key techniques and libraries utilized:

Pandas: Pandas is a versatile data manipulation library that was used for data loading, cleaning, and transformation. It facilitated the conversion of monthly data into quarterly intervals.

Plotly: The visualization libraries were crucial for creating insightful charts and graphs to showcase GDP growth, recession periods, and severity analysis.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of economic recessions using Python. By visualizing GDP growth, converting data to quarterly intervals, identifying and analyzing recession periods, and assessing severity, the project offers insights into the economic health of a nation during recessionary periods. The utilization of Python libraries like Pandas, Plotly makes the analysis efficient and insightful.
